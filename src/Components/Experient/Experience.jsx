                Over the past 3 years, I have immersed myself in the world of web development,
                particularly focusing on the MERN stackâ€”MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
                This journey has been a dynamic and rewarding experience, marked by hands-on learning,
                project development, and a continuous quest for knowledge.
